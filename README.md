A collection of algorithms from different sources.

Why is it here?

This is a collection of interesting problem I have come across over time. This repository serves both as an archive of the solutions and a portal for others to work on the solutions.

What else is there?
===================

The WiKi page of the repository contains some explanations and there are some on my blog: https://abhi.im/category/algorithms/.
