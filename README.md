This is a collection of algorithm and data structure problems I do during my free time. Some of the implementations may not be the best and in that case it is my request that you please email your implementation to me at abhishek@abhis.ws, so that we may learn from each other. The repository started off when I was preparing for my Amazon tech interview but has continued ever since purely as a way to log all the problems practiced.
